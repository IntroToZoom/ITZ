The Zoom program lets one user, called the <B>Host</B>, start a meeting and invite other users called the <B>Participants</B> by sending them an email invitation or by directly inviting them through a Zoom contacts list. The person receiving the email clicks on a link to start downloading Zoom and join the meeting. Alternatively, if they have Zoom installed they can enter a Meeting ID (and sometimes a Password), which is also found in the email invitation to join a meeting..

<H2>2. How to create your own Zoom seminar in these days of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic</H2>

In the days B.C. (before coronavirus), a group of friends would go downtown to attend an event or lecture. During breaks in the event, they could discuss what was heard. Afterwards they could go out to lunch and talk about the event. In the age of COVID-19 that option is no longer available. 

The pandemic has eliminated some options but has opened new ones. Visual technologies like Zoom, Skype, etc. have given us more options for group interaction, along with YouTube and other free video media for presenting lectures and concerts. Many organizations have switched from live events to provide live-streamed events using high quality video and audio. Often these live-streamed events are saved in Internet-accessible archives.

This provides an alternative way for a group of friends to attend an event together – a kind of “watch party”. With the availability of these new technologies, they can watch together from around the country or around the world.

If you have the time and want to get together with a few friends, perhaps you can find a Web event that everyone might be interested in and hold your own personal Zoom meeting. For those who want to skip directly to how to go about it, go to <B>Appendices A, B <B>and</B> <B>C</B>.
